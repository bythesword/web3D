	Dry Rocky Gorge
	---------------

	This is a very simple terrain example, and not much different to the many others on here. 
	Overall, it's not that inspiring - After all, there are only so many ways you can render a
	terrain scene; Terrain, sky, fake normal-based ground coloring. Not much effort went into 
	it. In fact, I probably spent more time choosing the ground texture and sky color than 
	creating the terrain. :) 

    I've been playing around with low-poly terrain lately, but believe it or not, using a modern
	machine to emulate the way things looked on old machines isn't always as easy as you'd think. :)
	Therefore, I took a break and coded up a very cliche medium-level terrain fly-though.

	The lighting is fudged in a lot of places - especially where the clouds are concerned, so I
	wouldn't pay too much attention to it. In fact, you could ignore most of the code and just 
	look at the camera setup and distance function.

	The geometry is very basic. Render a plane, carve out a squarish tube, wrap it around the
	camera path, then add some noise layers to the result. Not much to it. For the terrain itself,
	I'd hoped to make use of IQ's gradient noise derivatives code, but speed was an issue, so I let 
	it go. Maybe next time. :)

	There wouldn't be much code here if it were not for the cloud layering routine that I dropped
    in. It's only used for four layers, which meant the aesthetic returns were rather diminished, 
	so it was hardly worth the effort.

	Anyway, I have a lot of more interesting examples than this that I hope to add at some point.
